## Diamond Price Prediction Analysis 

Goal: Supporting smarter decisions in the jewelry industry; help buyers avoid overpaying and sellers price competitively. Wanting to answer the question: How does quality and physical factors influence diamond price, and can we accurately predict its price using these features?

Data Content: Our dataset was imported from Kaggle and it consisted of 53,940 round-cut diamonds with 10 attributes (carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, dimensions). Dataset is recognized for having no missing values, however some rows have zero values in columns x, y, and z. ( length (mm), width (mm), and depth (mm)
Went over 5 models that could ultimately help us predict diamond prices. 

Conclusions and Findings: Random Forest gave us the lowest error, and an RMSE of $ 535.14, and discovered that size and carat of the diamond are the most important features.
